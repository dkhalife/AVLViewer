AVLViewer
===============

This Java Swing application allows you to create AVL trees by performing insertions and deletions in a graphical way.

Instructions:
-------------

The application contains a single text box allowing you to enter a number. And two buttons to pick the operation (Add or Delete).

Currently, the number is limited to the range -9 to 99 for display reasons.

The display is automatically updated after each operation.

In case the tree becomes big you can drag the pannel to move around and see the cropped reigons.
